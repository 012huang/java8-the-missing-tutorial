Java 8: The Missing Tutorial
--------------

Java 8 is not a new topic anymore. There are many good books published on it. Still I meet many Java developers unaware of the power of Java 8. The goal of this microbook is to cover some of the most important Java 8 features and how they can help developers in their day to day programming. This is based on my [7 days with Java 8 blog](http://shekhargulati.com/7-days-with-java-8/) blog series.
